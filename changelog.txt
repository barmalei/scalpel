Changes v1.2.1 since v1.2.0
===========================

* throw out dummy StructuredText class from ilps/tae/text/module
* AnnotatedText class has been added to support parsing various type of annotated texts
* switch and re-implement some part of coNLL collection to the new AnnotatedText implementation
* conll 2003 format can be transformed to conll2002. 2003 format is slightly different what 
  makes impossible to use Lingpipe tagger CoNLL parser to train on CoNLL2003 corpus. 
* new training model for Lingpipe has been included: 
    -- CoNLL 2002 (hmm and lm) for spanish
    -- CoNLL 2003 (hmm and lm) for english
    -- CoNLL 2002 (hmm and lm) for dutch
* small adjustment with stanford NER features to improve recognition quality 
* some correction and improvement for NERs model mapping, use alias like "best" per language 
  to select the best model for the given language. 
* bunch of bug fixes and small corrections 
* extend test-cases to cover more functionality 


Changes v1.3.0 since v1.2.1
===========================

* NERs Jython support. Allow users to run JAVA based NERs (Stanford, Lingpipe, LbJ) in JVM
  what can prevent NERs from multiple loading of training data 
* Stanford POS Jython support
* Custom JAVA classes loader can help to avoid class names clashes for stuff run under Jython 
* New test cases (Class loader, Jython)
* Jython deployment. Add Jython package to TAE
* Sonar corpus support
* Bug fixes and improvements in common package
* JUnit deployment has been added. It is necessary to run JAVA test cases
* Small part of Sonar corpus deployment has been added
* New Stanford NER version
* ILPS sentiment corpus support
* ILPS primitive sentiment analyzer 
* Standalone runner integration: the most important classes can be run from command line:
    $ python lib/gravity/tae/ner/stanford/ner.py  "text" | file

	  or even shorter 

    $ bin/NER "text" | file   
    $ bin/lingpipe.NER "text" | file   
    $ bin/tnt.NER "text" | file
