#  Basic Rj function implementation. 
#  Rj function is bit array where every bit is used as an indication whether
#  the given pattern match the given fragment of text by j character. This
#  function is key for bitap search. Rj function defines a level of difference 
#  for two string it compares. The special thing about Rj is it is set to 1
#  for -1 character.

    #  all characters have been used in the given pattern and its

    #  the pattern where it has been mentioned.
